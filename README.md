## 🚀 Why This Exists

React is JavaScript. But not all of JavaScript is needed to get started. This guide helps you focus on **just the essentials**, so you don’t waste time or get overwhelmed.

If you’ve asked yourself:
- “Do I need to master JavaScript before React?”
- “What exactly do I need to know?”
- “Where should I start?”

This repo is for you.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

| ✅ Topic | 💡 Description |
|----------|----------------|
| Variables & Data Types | `let`, `const`, types like strings, numbers, arrays, and objects |
| Functions & Scope | Arrow functions, function expressions, block scope |
| Arrays & Objects | Creating, modifying, looping |
| ES6+ Features | Destructuring, spread/rest, template literals |
| Array Methods | `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and how React uses them |
| Promises & Async/Await | Handle async code without pain |
| Modules | `import` and `export` — just like React components |
| DOM vs JSX | Why React uses JSX instead of manipulating the DOM directly |
